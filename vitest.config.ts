/**
 * Runner config consumed by the `@angular/build:unit-test` builder
 * (see the `runnerConfig` option in angular.json).
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * - The builder runs Vitest with `isolate: false` by default, so every spec shares one
 *   module registry. With a shared registry, a `vi.mock()` in one spec leaks into the
 *   others and load order decides which factory wins - that made `@supabase/supabase-js`
 *   mocks apply intermittently and let the real Supabase client (live HTTP + auth
 *   auto-refresh timers) load inside jsdom specs. `isolate` is re-enabled in angular.json.
 * - Isolation spawns one worker per spec file. Windows fork startup is slow enough to hit
 *   `[vitest-pool]: Timeout starting forks runner`, so use the threads pool instead:
 *   same isolation guarantee, much cheaper start-up. Worker count is capped because
 *   booting Angular + jsdom in every worker at once also times out pool start-up.
 * - A worker cannot exit while a timer is still pending, and this app schedules long
 *   ones (`OTP_TTL_SECONDS` is 10 minutes). `teardownTimeout` bounds shutdown so a
 *   straggler surfaces as an error instead of an apparent freeze; `src/test-setup.ts`
 *   also clears leaked handles after every test. Prefer `npm run test:safe`, which
 *   kills the process tree if the run still refuses to exit.
 * - `resolve.alias` mirrors the `@/*` path mapping in tsconfig.json. The builder passes
 *   the tsconfig paths through when tests run via `ng test`, but a bare `npx vitest`
 *   only reads this file, so the alias has to be declared here too.
