      question: 'What happens during my first session?',
      answer: 'Your first session is mostly a conversation. You will talk about what brought you here, what you would like support with, and what pace feels comfortable, and you can ask anything you want before deciding what to focus on together. Sessions can be held in any of the languages listed on this profile.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many sessions will I need?',
      answer: 'There is no fixed number, because it depends on what you are working through and what you want from therapy. Some people come for a few focused sessions, others continue over a longer period. You and your therapist can review how things are going and adjust as you go.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I switch therapists if I don’t feel the right connection?',
      answer: 'Yes, and it is a normal thing to ask for. Feeling comfortable with your therapist matters more than staying with the first one you booked. You can browse other profiles on Calmi and book someone whose approach, language, or availability suits you better.',
