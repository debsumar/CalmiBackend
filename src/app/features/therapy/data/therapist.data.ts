        quote: `I put off therapy for almost three years because I assumed I would have to explain my whole life story before anything useful happened, and I did not think I had the energy for that. What actually happened with ${firstName(name)} was very different. The first session was mostly me talking in circles, and instead of pushing me toward a framework, she reflected back the patterns she was hearing and asked whether they sounded familiar. They did, painfully so. Over the following months we worked on the difference between a thought and a fact, on why I treated rest as something I had to earn, and on the specific situations at work that reliably tipped me into a spiral. She gave me small experiments to try between sessions rather than homework I would resent, and when something did not work she was genuinely curious about why instead of treating it as non-compliance. There were weeks where I made no visible progress and she never made me feel like I was failing at recovery. What changed most is not that the hard days disappeared, because they have not, but that I now notice them arriving instead of only realising afterwards, and I have things I can actually do at that point. My family has commented that I sound less braced for impact on the phone. If you are reading this while hesitating the way I did, I would say the version of therapy I feared and the version I got were not the same thing at all.`,
